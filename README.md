# Rock-paper-scissors
Learning how to create a simple rock-paper-scissors game using Python Tkiner

How it works:
Once the player chooses one of the three options and clicks "Spin", the output result will be printed in the bottom and the score will be refreshed at the top of the screen, and an image of the PC's selection will be shown. (for example if the PC selects paper it will only be shown after the player clicks the "Spin" button making it impossible for the player to know the PC's answer)
